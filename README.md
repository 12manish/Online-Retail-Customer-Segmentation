## Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
In this project we tackle the problem of Customer segmentation which plays a crucial rule in modern customer-centric marketing. We utilize the RFM model for customer sigmentation in addition to two more measures, First_purchase and No. of unique items.

## Dataset
This Online Retail II data set contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers (The dataset is available on UCI [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II)).

   1. InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal. A 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with the letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.
   2. StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal. A 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
